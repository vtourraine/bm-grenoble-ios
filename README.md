## How it works

The Grenoble Municipal Library doesn’t offer a public API to check your account status and loans. This app uses a hidden web view instead, programmatically signing in with the user credentials, then extracting the relevant data by parsing the HTML pages.

## Features

- List current loans
- News
- Libraries list with info and map
- Search books

## Roadmap

- Agenda
- Local notification for reminders
- Items cover image
- Renew loans
- Reservations
- Multiple accounts support

## Experimental features

These features are being implemented, and might be available in beta version, but not on the App Store.

- Subscriber card: in-app barcodes are difficult to scan in libraries
